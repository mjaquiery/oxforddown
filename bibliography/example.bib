  issn = {1543-4494, 1543-4508},
  abstract = {Following training to match 2- and 8-sec durations of feederlight to red and green comparisons with a 0-sec baseline delay, pigeons were allowed to choose to take a memory test or to escape the memory test. The effects of sample omission, increases in retention interval, and variation in trial spacing on selection of the escape option and accuracy were studied. During initial testing, escaping the test did not increase as the task became more difficult, and there was no difference in accuracy between chosen and forced memory tests. However, with extended training, accuracy for chosen tests was significantly greater than for forced tests. In addition, two pigeons exhibited higher accuracy on chosen tests than on forced tests at the short retention interval and greater escape rates at the long retention interval. These results have not been obtained in previous studies with pigeons when the choice to take the test or to escape the test is given before test stimuli are presented. It appears that task-specific methodological factors may determine whether a particular species will exhibit the two behavioral effects that were initially proposed as potentially indicative of metacognition.},

  title = {Intrinsic Value of Social Influence over Others},
  abstract = {The view that social rewards, such as social status and prestige, have intrinsic value has been supported by social psychology theories and neuroscientific studies. Here we look at crucial aspect of social status and ask whether influencing others is strong enough a motivation, that to secure it one might be willing to forgo monetary payoffs, and what are the factors that affect such direct status seeking behaviour. We examined online and lab-based participants while playing an advice-giving game, competing with a rival adviser for influence over a client. Majority of participants were ready to forgo financial reward to increase their chance of being selected over their rival. Payments for influence were higher when the client did not favour the participant, and when the participant's recent advice ware accurate. Participants also used advice confidence as self-promotion signal, increasing it to gain influence, and decreasing it to maintain influence. Our findings highlight the intrinsic value of social influence, and the social-factors and cognitive mechanisms used to gain and maintain it.},
