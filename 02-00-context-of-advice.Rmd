# Context of Advice {#chapter-context}

<!-- here we present all that mathematical optimum stuff where Soll and Larrik cover the boundary conditions under which averaging is an optimum strategy vs when it is disadvantagenous. 

We also discuss the general tendency to view egocentric discounting as a deviation from a normative strategy. 

We introduce the idea of sensitivity to context, initially in terms of evolutionary adapatation, but also in terms of adaptive behaviour (flexbile response to dynamic environment) as a lead-in for the evolutionary modelling and then behavioural experiments. -->

Optimal advice policy differs by context.
