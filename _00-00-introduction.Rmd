My research aims to combine agent-based computational modelling with psychological theories of advisor evaluation processes that produce biases in assimilation of information and source selection, and to compare the structures of networks produced using these processes to naturally occurring social networks. The organisation is as follows: this introduction establishes the core concepts invoked in this thesis, and describes their treatment in the literature; the following sections each include a short chapter on the specific question addressed and the techniques used, a detailed description of the work conducted, and a short discussion of the conclusions drawn from the work; and a final section offers broader conclusions arising as a consequence of the presented work, alongside some suggestions for related research. 

## Advice {-}

Advice is broadly defined as information which comes from a social source. Advice is therefore different from other sources of information in that it is the result of (at least) mental processing of other information. In some cases, it may additionally include discussions among different group members (e.g. advice from the International Advisory Panel on Climate Change). Throughout this thesis, the focus is primarily on advice which comes from a single, stable source, as when we see a post by an acquaintance on social media, or when a stranger provides us with advice.

## Advice-taking {-}

Advice occurs in the context of a decision, and forms a part of the information which is integrated during the decision-making process to produce a decision. To the extent that the decision reached differs from the decision that would have occurred had the advice not been presented, the advice has had an effect on the decision; to the extent that this difference changes the decision in a way consistent with the advice, the advice has been 'taken' (as opposed to 'rejected').

It is tacitly implied by many operationalizations of advice-taking that the informational content of the advice determines the extent to which it is taken or rejected `citation needed`. Insofar as the identity of the advisor matters, it matters because it functions as a cue to the informational content of the advice. This is likely a major oversimplification, however, because in many real-world contexts advice-giving and advice-taking form part of a developing social relationship: being consulted for advice and having one's advice followed are inherently rewarding [@hertzIntrinsicValueSocial2018; @hertzNeuralComputationsUnderpinning2017]; and taking advice can serve as a (sometimes costly) social signal of valuing a relationship with a person or group `citation needed`. While this thesis follows previous literature in omitting to consider the wider social concerns influencing the taking of advice, it is nevertheless important to remember that the processes investigated herein take place in a variety of social contexts where complex social agents attempt to optimise over numerous goals over numerous timescales.
