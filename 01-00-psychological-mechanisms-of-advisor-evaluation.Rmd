# Psychological mechanisms of advisor evaluation {#chapter-advisor-evaluation}

Where feedback is unavailable, people may use their own sense of certainty as a yardstick for evaluating advice [@pescetelliRoleDecisionConfidence2018; @pescetelliUseMetacognitiveSignals2017]: advisors who agree when one is confident are perceived as more helpful; while those who disagree when one is confident are perceived as less helpful. Confidence serves as a proxy for objective feedback, and functions well in this role insofar as the judge has high metacognitive resolution (i.e. higher confidence is indicative of a greater probability of being correct).

## Judge-advisor system

## Table of experiments

Advisors | Choice | Task | Feedback | Result
---------|--------|------|----------|-------
AiC vs AiU | Yes | Perceptual, binary (MATLAB) | No | Suggestive
AiC vs AiU | Yes | Perceptual, binary | No | Inconclusive
In/accurate| Yes | Perceptual, binary | No | Accuracy selected more often
Low/High agreement| Yes | Perceptual, binary | No | Agreement selected more often
Accurate vs Agreement | No | Estimation, continuous | Yes and No | Accurate preferred given feedback, agreement preferred without feedback

<!-- This is where the maths for advisor quality estimation should go. How do we work out the quality of an advisor using individual bits of advice as evidence? Feedback, no feedback. -->
