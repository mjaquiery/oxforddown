# Behavioural responses to advice contexts {#chapter-context-benevolence}

<!-- 
Present behavioural experiments in which we show sensitivity to both the advisor and the advice, and discuss the relatively high levels of advice-taking (hard task!), and how the results support the impressions gleaned from the evolutionary models: context matters in advice-taking, and discounting may be a feature of vigilant conservatism (hyperprior for deceit). 
-->

Actual advice-taking behaviour differs by context.
