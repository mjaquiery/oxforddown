# Psychology of advice-taking {#chapter-advice-taking}
\minitoc

<!-- Here should be a detailed introduction. Niccolo's stuff about advice-taking, and then introduce my research on advisor selection. Maybe merge this with the previous section. -->

The model of advisor evaluation [described earlier](#advisor-evaluation-without-feedback) requires empirical support. The model of advisor evaluation with feedback is well supported by data which indicate that, given objective feedback, people can use the feedback to learn about the trustworthiness of advisors. The [extent to which advice is taken](#!TODO[link to measures of advice in method]) is commonly used as a measure of a participant's trust in an advisor, on the argument that the participant seeks to maximise task performance and task performance is maximised by taking more advice from more trustworthy advisors. !TODO[Mini lit review - advisor accuracy training with feedback (Yaniv?), Niccolo and Nick's feedback stuff]. Overall, this means that people prefer more accurate advice over less accurate advice.

When objective feedback is unavailable, people can still demonstrate a greater dependence upon advice from more as opposed to less accurate advisors. !TODO[Mini lit review, Niccolo's stuff, maybe prior stuff - check Niccolo's thesis for references]. This is a consequence of agreement: where the base probability of being correct is greater than chance, the independent estimates of people who are more accurate will agree more often (leading to 100% agreement on the correct answer for two independent decision-makers of perfect accuracy). In the absence of feedback, therefore, agreement can be used as a proxy for accuracy, as formalised in the model.

The role of agreement is demonstrated clearly in experiments where the objective accuracy of advisors is balanced, but the agreement rates of the advisors is varied. !TODO[cite Niccolo @CITATION_NEEDED]. Pescetelli and Yeung demonstrated that advice is more influential from advisors who tend to agree with a participant more frequently when objective feedback is not provided. This is despite the fact that advice is more influential when it disagrees with the participant's initial estimate.^[This is partly due to the nature of the judge-advisor system: there is always room for disagreement to be more extreme than agreement, because agreement is bounded by the participant's intial estimate.] These data suggest that people may be using agreement as a proxy for accuracy, although they may simply prefer agreement over disagreement when there is no accuracy cost to be paid. I report the results of an experiment in which an agreeing advisor was compared with an accurate advisor under conditions of feedback or no feedback. Results indicated that, as predicted by the models, participants preferred the accurate advisor when feedback was provided and the agreeing advisor when feedback was witheld.

!TODO[move this section to a discussion somewhere?] An alternative explanation for the data is that disagreeing advice is more surpising when it comes from an advisor who usually agrees, and that it is its increased salience increases its influence rather than increased trust in the advisor. If that were the case then the same ought to be true for agreeing advice from a disagreeing advisor, and this is not the case !TODO[Do we have/can we produce evidence for this? Perhaps look at our participants where advisors disagree with them by chance more than e.g. 70% of the time and check for increased influence on agreement trials vs advisors who disagree less than 70% of the time].
