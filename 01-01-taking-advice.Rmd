# Psychology of advice-taking {#chapter-advice-taking}

<!-- Here should be a detailed introduction. Niccolo's stuff about advice-taking, and then introduce my research on advisor selection. Maybe merge this with the previous section. -->

The advisors are virtual agents whose probability of agreeing with the participant’s decision varies as a function of the participant’s confidence and correctness in the initial decision phase. Table \ref@(tab:ex1_advisor) illustrates how this relationship functions, and shows that the overall correctness and agreement rates of the advisors is equivalent overall. Importantly, on largest minority of trials, the middle 40%, the advisors are exactly equivalent, meaning these trials can be compared directly without confounds arising from agreement rate and initial confidence.
