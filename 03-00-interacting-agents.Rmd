# Interaction of psychological processes across minds {#chapter-interacting-agents}

<!-- Models suggest interactions between agents exascerbate problems, especially where source selection and info weighting combine. -->

\mccorrect{!TODO[extend the simulation/agreement-effects-analysis stuff a bit and it will fill this chapter out well.]}

* Even when biases don't change (Niccolo covered that), source selection on the basis of agreement is inherently pathological.  
  - This is true whether or not confidence weights updating. 

* Why should we care if it's not changing biases (i.e. opinions?)  
  - because it reinforces final decisions through agreement instead of attenuating them through disagreement. 

* Our psychological mechanisms from Section II thus produce bad network effects when feedback is absent. 

* Can we relate the networks back to the advice-giving environments from Section III?

Models say this will go horribly wrong.
